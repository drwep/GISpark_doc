    "[Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/README.html#usage) is OGR’s neat, nimble, no-nonsense API for Python programmers.\n",
    "https://travis-ci.org/Toblerity/Fiona.png?branch=master\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and writing data in standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python types and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and iterators instead of classes specific to OGR. Fiona can read and write real-world data using multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and integrates readily with other Python GIS packages such as pyproj, Rtree, and Shapely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collections\n",
    "Records are read from and written to file-like Collection objects returned from the fiona.open() function. Records are mappings modeled on the GeoJSON format. They don’t have any spatial methods of their own, so if you want to do anything fancy with them you will probably need Shapely or something like it. Here is an example of using Fiona to read some records from one data file, change their geometry attributes, and write them to a new data file."
